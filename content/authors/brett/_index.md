I am a PhD candidate specializing in Political Behavior and Methodology in the [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.duke.edu/) at Duke University.

During the 2019-2020 academic year, I will serve as a [Program for Advanced Research in the Social Sciences (PARISS) Fellow](https://ssri.duke.edu/education/program-advanced-research-social-sciences-pariss) with the [Social Science Research Institute](https://ssri.duke.edu/) and Humane Studies Fellow with the [Institute for Humane Studies](https://theihs.org/).

I employ quantitative methods to answer questions at the intersection of political economy and political behavior. My substantive interests are in taxation and redistribution, economic and political inequality, preference and belief formation, and behavioral geography.

As a proponent of transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility in the social sciences, I serve as a Catalyst for the [Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences](https://www.bitss.org/).

I have taught or assisted in teaching courses in both American Politics and Comparative Politics, as well as political behavior and political economy, such as Introduction to Political Economy, Political Psychology, and The Politics of Inequality. As PARISS Fellow, I also provide interdisciplinary methodological assistance to students and researchers at Duke University.

In addition to my academic work, I also consult and conduct research for governments and NGOs, primarily in the areas of economic development and governance. Both individually and as an affiliated researcher of the [DevLab@Duke](https://sites.duke.edu/devlab/), I have contributed my expertise to organizations including the [U.K. Department for Innovation, Business & Skills](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-innovation-skills), [Social Impact](https://socialimpact.com/), [RTI International](https://www.rti.org/), and [AidData](https://www.aiddata.org/). I also contribute to the work of the [Worldview Lab](https://kenan.ethics.duke.edu/attitudes/students/worldview-lab/) at Duke University.
