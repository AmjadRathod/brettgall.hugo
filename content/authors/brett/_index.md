I am a PhD candidate specializing in Political Behavior and Methodology in the [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.duke.edu/) at Duke University. 

I employ quantitative methods to answer questions at the intersection of political economy and political behavior, particularly those related to taxation and redistribution, economic and political inequality, and preference and belief formation.

During the 2019-2020 academic year, I am a Program for Advanced Research in the Social Sciences (PARISS) Fellow with the [Social Science Research Institute](https://ssri.duke.edu/) and Humane Studies Fellow with the [Institute for Humane Studies](https://theihs.org/). As a proponent of transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility in the social sciences, I also serve as a Catalyst for the [Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences](https://www.bitss.org/).

I have taught or assisted in teaching courses in both American Politics and Comparative Politics, primarily on topics in political behavior and political economy. Additionally, I provide methodological assistance to students, faculty, and university-affilitated researchers through as a PARISS Fellow.

In addition to my academic work, I consult and conduct research for governments and NGOs, primarily in the areas of economic development and governance. Both independently and as an affiliated researcher of the [DevLab@Duke](https://www.devlabduke.com/), I have contributed to the work of organizations including the [U.K. Department for Innovation, Business & Skills](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-innovation-skills), [Social Impact](https://socialimpact.com/), [RTI International](https://www.rti.org/), and [AidData](https://www.aiddata.org/). I also contribute to the interdisciplinary work of the [Worldview Lab](https://kenan.ethics.duke.edu/attitudes/students/worldview-lab/) at Duke University.
