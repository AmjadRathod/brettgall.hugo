# brettgall.hugo

This repository contains the source files for my website, http://brettgall.com. 

I leverage the [Academic](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/) theme of the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to build and continuously deploy a fast, clean site from RMarkdown, HTML, and CSS files pushed to this repository.

Many thanks to [@apreshil](https://github.com/apreshill),  [@gcushen](https://github.com/gcushen), and [@kjhealy](https://github.com/kjhealy) for providing themes and educational resources for producing this site.
